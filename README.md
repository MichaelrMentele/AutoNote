A simple note appending app with a simple GUI that is really only useful on Windows. It basically allows you to append notes to 'buckets' or files of related notes using hashtags. 

This can be easily replace in Linux/Unix environments with a single line of bash script. 

I may modify it as a CLI bash utility, but we will see.
